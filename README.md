# Iconify Monorepo **WIP**

This repository hosts multiple Flutter packages, each corresponding to a specific [Iconify](https://iconify.design/) icon family. The goal is to provide a more granular and flexible installation option than the unified [`flutter_iconify`](https://github.com/andronasef/iconify_flutter/) package, allowing developers to include only the icons they need.

## Features
- Separate packages for each icon family
- Reduced code footprint by installing only selected library icons
- Consistent API for easy usage across different families

## Getting Started
No data available for now.

## Contributions
Contributions are welcome. Please open an issue or pull request for any needed updates or icon additions.
